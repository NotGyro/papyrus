# Changelog

## 0.4.0

----

- First pass refactoring towards library stablisation.
- Added `ExternCrate` support. You can now use `extern crate crate_name as alias;`. This will work in most cases, please raise a PR if it doesn't.
- Compilation status is redirected to the console.
- Panics now get shown, and statements won't be added if code panics.
